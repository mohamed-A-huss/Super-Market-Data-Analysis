# Supermarket Sales Data Cleaning and Analysis

This notebook documents the process of cleaning and preparing the "Supermarket Sales" dataset for analysis.
## Tools Used

* **Python** For Data Wrangling .
* **PowerBI**  For Visualization .
  
## Data Overview

The dataset contains information about supermarket sales, including:

* **Invoice ID:** Unique identifier for each transaction.
* **Branch:**  The branch where the sale occurred (A, B, or C).
* **City:** The city where the branch is located (Yangon, Mandalay, or Naypyitaw).
* **Customer type:** Type of customer (Member or Normal).
* **Gender:** Gender of the customer.
* **Product line:** Category of the product sold.
* **Unit price:** Price of a single unit of the product.
* **Quantity:** Number of units sold.
* **Tax 5%:** Tax applied to the sale.
* **Total:** Total amount of the sale.
* **Date:** Date of the sale.
* **Time:** Time of the sale.
* **Payment:** Payment method used.
* **Rating:** Customer rating of the shopping experience.

## Data Cleaning Process

### Quality Issues

* **Missing values:**  'Tax 5%' and 'Total' columns had missing values.
* **Invalid data types:** 'Unit price' contained 'USD' and needed to be converted to float. 'Invoice ID' contained hyphens and needed to be converted to int.
* **Inconsistent values:** 'Customer type' had inconsistent values (e.g., 'Memberr' instead of 'Member').
* **Incorrect values:** 'Rating' had an incorrect value (97). 'Quantity' had negative values.
* **Duplicate rows:**  Duplicate rows were identified and removed.

### Tidiness Issues

* **Multiple columns representing one variable:**  'Yangon', 'Naypyitaw', and 'Mandalay' columns represented the same variable 'City'.

### Cleaning Steps

1. **Remove duplicates:** Duplicate rows were dropped.
2. **Fix 'Rating' values:**  Replaced the incorrect value 97 with 9.7.
3. **Fix 'Quantity' values:**  Converted negative values to positive.
4. **Clean 'Invoice ID':** Removed hyphens and converted to int.
5. **Clean 'Unit price':** Removed 'USD' and converted to float.
6. **Clean 'Customer type':** Corrected inconsistent values.
7. **Fill missing values:**  Filled missing values in 'Tax 5%' and 'Total' columns based on other values.
8. **Clean 'Time':** Removed 'PM' and converted to 24-hour format.
9. **Create 'City' column:**  Combined 'Yangon', 'Naypyitaw', and 'Mandalay' columns into a single 'City' column.

## Data Tidying

* **Combined columns:**  The 'Yangon', 'Naypyitaw', and 'Mandalay' columns were combined into a single 'City' column by creating a function to map branch codes to city names.


## Power BI Dashboard

1. **Total Orders:** Processed 1,000 transactions.
2. **Total Sales:** Achieved 323K in sales across all branches.
3. **Net Profit:** Earned 308K after deducting taxes and other expenses.
4. **Taxes Collected:** Collected 15K in taxes, which accounts for 5% of total sales.
5. **Customer Rating:** Received an average customer satisfaction rating of 6.97.
6. **Sales by Gender:** A pie chart displays the sales distribution between male and female customers.
7. **Sales by City:** A treemap illustrates total sales across Yangon, Mandalay, and Naypyitaw.
8. **Sales by Branch:** A bar chart compares sales performance between branches A, B, and C.
9. **Sales by Customer Type:** A bar chart compares sales between 'Member' and 'Normal' customers.
10. **Sales by Month:** A line graph shows sales trends over the months of January, February, and March.
11. **Sales by Product Line:** A bar chart presents sales across categories like Food and Beverages, Fashion, and Electronics.

The dashboard allows for easy analysis of customer behaviors, branch performance, and product category sales, making it a valuable tool for decision-making and strategy formulation.

## Final Dataset
After data cleaning, the final dataset was exported as Cleaned_data.csv, which is now ready for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

## Conclusion
This project successfully cleaned and transformed the supermarket sales dataset. The accompanying Power BI dashboard provides valuable insights into sales performance, customer demographics, and product preferences, aiding the supermarket's management team in making data-driven decisions.
